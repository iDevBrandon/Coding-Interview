TypeScript day!
Gonna learn the basic & How to implement in React, Redux. Overall, have a project with React& Redux written in TypeScript

## 12/09/2021

Study hard algo, database(MySQL) and network(Assignment type coding test like fetching)
For english coding test, should prepare these at leetcode and hackerrank.
For KR one, should be enough with boj and programmers.

I really need to study MySQL as one of questions in the test is about database.
Even if i make MERN stack apps, MySQL is still important to learn.

I was not able to understand algorithm questions at all at the beginning. but thankfully, my skill is being improved.
But i do know that it is still not enough to become a software developer.
Should focus on the fundmental things rather than framework like React.
