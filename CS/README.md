Static page - reload the whole page 
AJAX 

# CSR(Client Server Rendering) 
SPA(Single Page Application) - rendering partly each components. Ex) React,View and Angular.
Request source code to server and create static page 

Drawback of CSR
1. Initial Loading may take too long 
2. Low SEO


# SSR (Server Side Rendering) - Next.js
Instead of dealing everything in clident side, Request to server and create HTML file with JS.
Show to client side.

Drawback of SSR
1. Blinking issue, non-rich site interactions 
2. Server side overhead - as it load from the server.
3. Need to wait before interacting
