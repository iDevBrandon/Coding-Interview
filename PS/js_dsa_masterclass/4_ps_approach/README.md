# Section 4: Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns - DONE

- Define what an algorithm is
  A process or set of steps to accomplish a certin task.

## Step 1 : Understand the problem

1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
5. How should i label important pieces of data?

## Step 2 : Explore concrete examples

coming up with examples

1. start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore exampels with invalid/empty inputs

charCount('aaaa') // {a:4,b:0,c:0}

## Step 3 : Break it down

This force you to think about the code you will write.

function charCount(str) {
    // do sth
    // return an object with alphabetcially order

    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each character...
        // if character is a number/letter in object, add one to count
        // if the char is not in object, add it and set value to 1
        // if character is something else, don't do anything

    // return object at end
}

## Step 4 : solve/simplify
