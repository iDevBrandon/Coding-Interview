Misc. algorithms and problem solving

## what is an algorithm?

Input -> Algorithm -> output 

Well defined inputs and outputs 

## Time and space complexity

Time complexity - amount of time taken by an algorithm to run

Space complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run

How to represent complexity 
Big O Notation - Worst case complexity

## Big O Notation 

function answer(n) {
    let sum = 0; // 1
    for (let i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        sum += i; // 4
    }
    return sum; // 1
}

N + 2 is expexress 
Time complexity O(N) - Linear

Space complexity 
O(1) - Constant
O(N) - Linear
O(logN) - Logarithmic

## Objects and Arrays Big-O

Objects for Big O
Insert - O(1)
Remove - O(1)
Access - O(1)
Search - O(N)

Array - Big O
Insert/Remove at end - O(1)
Insert/remove at beginner - O(n)
forEach/map/filter/reduce - O(n)
